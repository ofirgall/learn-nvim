# Why should I learn nvim?
As a professional, you are going to spend a lot of time on your computer, especially editing code. You want do it in the most fun and efficient way.
nvim is fun: fun to learn, fun to write with, fun to improve at and most importantly - it is very very efficient.

#### You can use vim with any keyboard
vim gives you the option to use only the basic keyboard keys: the alphabetical keys, ctrl, alt, shift, escape, enter. \
You don't need to find where is end, pageup/down and home each time you switch a keyboard/laptop.

If you can type on a keyboard, you can use vim the way you're used to.

#### Keep your hands on the keyboard
vim can be used without a mouse at all, and it's even recommended to use it this way, as it will "force" you to stay in the "flow" while programming without needing to move your hand over to the mouse and back to the keyboard.

vim is designed to be used with [type touching](https://www.ratatype.com/static/i/learn/keyboard/en/keyboard.webp).\
The important binds are on/next to the keys your hands should always be on: `asdf jkl;`. \
It isn't a must to touch type (I don't touch type 100%) but I recommend trying to switch anyways.

#### The right way to program
It's a strong saying but I'm convinced that `nvim` is the right way to program. 

When you're using vim, you "talk" to the editor rather than "move" it. \
Imagine, instead of asking your friend to pour you a glass of water, you would give instructions to your friend on how to pour you a glass of water, which would look like something like this:
1. Open the bottle
1. Grab the glass
1. Grab the bottle
1. Make an angle with the bottle towards the glass
1. Put down the bottle
1. Close the bottle

Wouldn't it be easier to just say "Hey, can you pour me glass of water?"
Well, that how it feels to use other editors after you're using vim, vim lets you "talk" to the editor.

#### Feel "at home" everywhere
Most TUIs programs support `vim` binds which will make you feel fast in any program that you usually use, `less`, `man`, `tmux` and many more.

You can feel "at home" in browsers too, with the [vimium extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/he/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/)

Edit files through `ssh` with ease

#### Lightweight and Native
nvim is lightweight, starts up fast, renders fast and a lot of the plugins tend to use a strong native binary to run the heavyweight tasks. \
For example, to search for text across the project [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) runs [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).

#### Rich plugin ecosystem
nvim has a huge community that develops plugins for everything you can and can't imagine. \
nvim doesn't miss on any IDE feature that other IDEs have to offer. \
nvim plugins are the first to "evolve" when a new tech is coming to the IDE world, the nvim community is the first to adapt it, e.g: ripgrep

You can take a look at the [awesome nvim plugin list](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim). I recommend to "watch" to get updates about new plugins.
